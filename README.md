### Objective

Your challenge is to build out a Rock, Paper, Scissors game  

Use **React** with **TypeScript** for front-end and **Java** with **Spring** for back-end.
``

### Brief

Build the game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to - choose **only one** option to develop.

Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also
a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Your users should be able to:

#### Front-end only part

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on your choice of implementation
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- See the longest winning sequence ever 

#### Including API

- Create an API to retrieve the choice of the "house" (rock, paper or scissors)
- Create an API to retrieve the longest winning sequence - it is up to you where to handle the state of the sequence, but eventually it needs to be persisted (DB) and retrieved with every opening of the application.
- Bonus - instead of the API to retrieve the longest winning sequence, use sockets.

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beat Paper

### Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript** best practices
- Java, Spring and general BE best practices
- API contains required swagger documentation
- Show us your work through your commit history
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small
  program
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested? BE & FE

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. **Include a fully built version of your assignment in a folder
named public or dist**. Also, make sure the public/ or dist/ folder is not in your .gitignore file

### CodeSubmit

The task should not take more then 6 hours, in the case it does, please let us know how long did it take, this information is vital for us to improve our processes.
All the best and happy coding.
